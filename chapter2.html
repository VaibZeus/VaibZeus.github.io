            <p>
                The original versions of HTML
                allowed you many ways to format text on a web page. However, most of these methods were
                deprecated by the <a href="./glossary.html#Gw3c" class="glossary_anchors" id="w3c">W3C</a> when they later revised the HTML standards. This means the W3C
                discourages the use of those tags, in favor of style sheets. Why? Because separating the styling
                details from the rest of the content makes for a much cleaner, more efficient web page—one
                more easily understood by browsers, search engines, and even your web site visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previous editions of this book explained those retired HTML tags—such as &lt;font&gt;
                and &lt;b&gt;, in case you’ve heard of them—as well as alternative ways to format text with style
                sheets. The only reason we continued to use those old tags was that many new browsers
                weren’t yet supporting style sheets. But times have changed, and there is no longer any valid
                reason for most web developers to use the font tag (or any other retired tags).
                With that said, the rest of this chapter will focus on how to use style sheets to format the
                text of your web pages.
            </p>

            <h2 id="organiseTxt">Organize Sections of Text</h2>
            <p>
                One important aspect of developing a web page is planning—especially when it comes to
                organizing sections of content on that page. A great strength of style sheets is the ability to
                easily apply groups of formatting characteristics to whole sections of text. For example,
                suppose you have three paragraphs and a list making up the main body copy of a page, and
                you want to see how the text in that section looks with a different font face and size. With the
                old font tag you would need to make multiple code changes just to try a different font. But as
                long as you’ve organized your content appropriately and used style sheets, the code changes
                will be minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key to all this is the div tag. Amazingly, adding a simple
                &lt;div&gt; to the code on your
                page will cause no outward change in appearance when viewed in the browser. In fact, the div
                tag does nothing by itself—it doesn’t even cause a line break. It is simply used as a container,
                allowing you to manipulate its contents later with style sheets.
            </p>

            <h3>Identifying Natural Divisions</h3>
            <p>
                It’s normal for a web page to have natural divisions according to the type of content found
                in each area of the page. A few common divisions or sections of a page might include the
                navigation, the body copy, the header, and the footer. The code used to separate each section
                might look similar to the following:
            </p>

            <pre class="line-numbers">
            <code>
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;div id="header"&gt;
                    Header content goes here.
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div id="bodyCopy"&gt;
                    Body copy goes here.
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div id="footer"&gt;
                    Footer content goes here.
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>

            <p>
                Once you’ve set up basic divisions like this—leaving the formatting to CSS instead of the
                HTML tables—the possibilities are endless. Need to move the navigation from the top of your
                page to the bottom . . . on ten different pages? If you put all of it into its own div . . . piece
                of cake! Not only is it easy to move that entire navigation bar, you only have to edit the style
                sheet—and not the individual HTML pages—to do so.
            </p>

            <h3>DIV + ID</h3>
            <p>
                When using the div tag to separate content areas, you also need to add the id attribute to
                give each division a name (as I did with header, bodyCopy, and footer in the previous code
                example). In the same way that a unique Social Security number is assigned as identification—
                ID—for each person living in the U.S., so should a unique name be given to each division on
                a web page. Once you’ve named your divisions, these content areas can easily be formatted in
                the site’s style sheet, which might look something like the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
            #header {border: 1px;}
            #bodyCopy {font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;}
            #footer {font-size: 10pt;}
        </pre>

            <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
            <p>
                You can also use the br tag to add a line break in your HTML page. Typing the br tag in
                HTML is the same as clicking the RETURN or ENTER key on your keyboard in a word processor. It
                causes the browser to stop printing text on that line and drop down to the next line on the page.
            </p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/Br.jpg" alt="exampleBR">
            <br>


            <h2 id="addHeading">Add Headings</h2>
            <p>
                One of the earliest means of formatting text was the heading tag. It is available in six levels of
                importance from
                %lt;h1&gt; down to %lt;h6&gt;, as shown in the following code:
            </p>
            <pre>
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;This is an example of heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt;
                    This is text under heading 1
                &lt;h2&gt;This is an example of heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;
                    This is text under heading 2
                &lt;h3&gt;This is an example of heading 3 &lt;/h3&gt;
                    This is text under heading 3
                &lt;h4&gt;This is an example of heading 4 &lt;/h4&gt;
                    This is text under heading 4
                &lt;h5&gt;This is an example of heading 5 &lt;/h5&gt;
                    This is text under heading 5
                &lt;h6&gt;This is an example of heading 6 &lt;/h6&gt;
                    This is text under heading 6
            &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre>
            <p>output:</p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/headings.jpg" alt="exampleHeading">
            <p id="tip">
                <b>Note:</b><br>
                Using a heading tag automatically adds breaks before and after the heading because
                these tags are <a href="./glossary.html#Gbct" class="glossary_anchors" id="bct">block-level container tags.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You use the heading tags to tell the browser which pieces of text function as headings, and
                then specify how to style them with CSS. So, you could quickly adjust the alignment of your
                headings with an <a href="./glossary.html#Ginline" class="glossary_anchors" id="inline">inline style</a> by using
                &lt;h3 style="text-align: right;"&gt;. Likewise,
                you could use h3 as a selector in an internal style sheet (placed in between the opening and
                closing head tags on your page) to specify the formatting options of all level-3 headings on the
                page.
            <pre>
            &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
            h3 {
            text-align: right;
            }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        </pre>
            </p>

            <br>


            <h2 id="styleSelection">Style Sections of Text by Changing Font Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
                Before you begin changing the font characteristics of a web page, you should note that visitors
                to your web site have the ultimate control over these font characteristics. The following screen
                shows how the user can customize one browser. Users can even choose to use their fonts,
                overriding page-specified fonts, so you should consider these tags as recommendations for the
                browser, but never rely on them for your page display.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/fontSetting.jpg" alt="exampleFontsettings" height="500px" width="800px">

            <h3>Font Faces</h3>
            <p>
                When used in conjunction with the term font, the term face refers to the name of the font
                you’d like to use on your page. In style sheets, we specify the font face with the font-family
                property.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use the font-family property to specify virtually any font name you can think of,
                but the person viewing your web page will be unable to see your page in that font face unless
                he already has it loaded on his computer. So, if you specify your page to be displayed in Gill
                Sans font, but the person viewing your page doesn’t have Gill Sans, he will see your page in
                the browser’s default font face (usually Times New Roman).
            </p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/Font.jpg" alt="exampleFont">
            <p>
                To compensate for the possibility that not all visitors will have the font you specify, you
                can specify backup fonts in the value of the font-family property. If the browser cannot find
                the first font face listed on the viewer’s computer, it then looks for the second font face, and
                the third, and so forth until it comes up with a match. Once again, if the browser doesn’t find a
                font face listed in your HTML file that is actually installed on the viewer’s system, it displays
                the page in the default font (usually Times New Roman).
            </p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/fontOptions.jpg" alt="fontOptions">
            <p id="tip">
                <b>Note:</b><br>
                This process of providing a backup font name is also referred to as cascading.
            </p>
            <img class="fullImage" src="./images/FontTypes.jpg" alt="FontTypes">

            <h3>Font Sizes</h3>
            <p>
                You can also use style sheets to change the size of the text. This is accomplished with the font-size
                property
                and any of the following possible values, as in: font-size: 12pt.
            </p>
            <p>
                ● <b>Keyword:</b> xx-small, x-small, small, medium,
                large, x-large, or
                xx-large <br>
                ● <b>Relative:</b> size Smaller or larger <br>
                ● <b>Absolute size:</b> Number followed by the unit, as in 12pt (for 12 point) or 8px (for 8 pixels)
            </p>
