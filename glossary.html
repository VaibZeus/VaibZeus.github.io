                        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
                        be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
                        and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                        An ASP is a server-side scripting environment used to create dynamic, interactive Web pages. It
                        contains HTML, which defines the page layout, fonts and graphic elements, and embedded
                        programming code that's written in a Microsoft scripting language.

                        XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined
                        tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. This is a
                        powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared.

                        A word processor is a program that enables the user to create documents, edit them using the
                        keyboard and
                        mouse, store them for later retrieval, and print them to a printer. Common word processing
                        applications include Microsoft Notepad, Microsoft Word, and Corel WordPerfect.

                        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
                        the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                        Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of
                        member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of

                        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from
                        left to right. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break
                        before and after the element. Other examples of the block-level tag are: Heading tags &lt;h1&gt;
                        to
                        &lt;h6&gt;.

                        An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles,
                        add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS
                        property.
                        Example: &lt;h3 style="text-align: right;"&gt;.

                        The accesskey global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the
                        current element. The attribute value must consist of a single printable character.

                        When referring to text, indent or indentation is the increase or decrease of space between the
                        left and right margin of a paragraph. To indent text, move the cursor to the front of the line
                        and press the Tab on the keyboard.

                        list. Use bullets to list items that do not have to be in any particular order. Numbers—or
                        letters—are used when information must be in a certain order.

                        A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each
                        step and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow
                        these rules to successfully transmit data.

                        The &lt;blockquote&gt; tag in HTML is used to display the long quotations (a section that is
                        quoted
                        from another source). It changes the alignment to make it unique from others. It contains
                        both opening and closing tags. In blockquote tag, we can use elements like heading, list,
                        paragraph, etc.
