                files are
                simply text files with two additional features.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    HTML files have an .html or .htm file extension. A file extension is an abbreviation that
                    associates the file with the appropriate program or tool needed to access it. In most cases,
                    this abbreviation follows a period and is three or four letters long.
                </li>

                    HTML files have tags. Tags are commands or code used to tell the computer how to display
                    the page content.
                </li>
            </ol>

                <b>Note: </b><br>
                You might also see more advanced types of pages on the Internet, such as

            <h2 id="prevHTML">Preview an HTML File in a Browser</h2>
            <p>
                You can view HTML files located on your personal computer within your own web browser.
                It isn’t necessary for your files to be stored on a web server until you are ready to make them
                visible on the Internet
            </p>
            <p>
                When you want to preview a page, open your web browser and choose File | Open (or Open Page or Open
                File,
                depending on your browser), and then browse through your hard drive until you locate the HTML file you
                want
                to open. (Note, if you don’t see any File menus in IE, try pressing the ALT key to reveal those menus.)

            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re going to make frequent changes to the HTML file in a text editor, and then switch back to a
                web
                browser to preview the page, keeping both programs (a text editor and a web browser) open at the same
                time
                makes sense. When using a basic text editor, the steps to edit and preview HTML files are
            <ol>
                <li>Open/return to your HTML file in a text editor.</li>
                <li>Edit your HTML file in a text editor.</li>
                <li>Save your HTML file in a text editor.</li>
                <li>Open/return to your HTML file in a web browser</li>
                <li>Click the Refresh or Reload button in your web browser to update the HTML page to reflect the
                    changes
                    you just made to it.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                By keeping your HTML file open in both a text editor and a browser, you can easily make and preview
                changes.
            </p>

            <h2 id="descHTMLFormat">Describe and Apply the Basic
                HTML Document Format</h2>
            <p>
                An HTML entity or tag is a command used to tell the browser how to display content on a
                page. This command is similar to what happens behind the scenes when you highlight some
                text in a <a href="./glossary.html#Gword" class="glossary_anchors" id="word">word processor</a> and
                click the Italic button to make the text italicized. <br>
                With HTML, instead of clicking a button to make text italicized, you can type a tag before
                and after the text you want to emphasize, as in the following: <br>
                <br>
                <em>&lt;em&gt; text will be emphasized &lt;/em&gt;</em>
            </p>
            <img class="fullImage" src="./images/em.jpg" alt="emphasize">
            <p>
                You can easily recognize tags because they are placed within brackets (<>), or less-than and
                    greater-than symbols. <br>
                    Did you notice that the tag to emphasize text and make it italic is em? Given that piece of
                    information, can you guess the tags to add a paragraph or create items in a list?
            </p>
            <table align="center" border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                    <th>Tags</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>creating paragraphs</td>
                    <td>&lt;p&gt;</td>

                    <td>add break line</td>
                    <td>&lt;br&gt;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>add table</td>
                    <td>&lt;table&gt;</td>

            <h2 id="setStylesheet">Set Up Style Sheets in an HTML File</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of <a href="./glossary.html#Gcss" class="glossary_anchors" id="css">cascading style sheets
                    (abbreviated CSS)</a> is to
                separate the style of a web page from its content. <br>
                The current HTML “rules” dictate that we only use HTML to identify the content of the
                page, and then use a style sheet to specify the presentation of that content. This not only makes
                web pages more accessible and usable to all users (regardless of their browsers, platforms,
                operating systems, physical limitations, and so forth), but also to search engines and other
                types of software.
            </p>
            <p id="tip">
                <b>Tip: </b><br>
                If you’ve ever used the Style drop-down menu in Microsoft Word, you’ve already used
                a style sheet of sorts. The most basic style sheet might include a style called “Body Text,”
                that specifies how the body text of the web page should look—which font and color to
                use, how much space to leave around it, and so on.
            </p>


            <h3>Define the Style</h3>
            <p>
                To define a basic formatting style, you first must identify which tag you want to affect. This
                tag is then called a selector in CSS. So, if you wanted to specify the style of all the level-2
                headlines (&lt;h2&gt;) on a page, you would use h2 as your selector. <br><br>
                h2 <br><br>
                In fact, the selector is essentially the tag without the brackets. With that in mind, can you
                guess what the selector for &lt;p&gt; would be? <br><br>
                p <br><br>
                Once you have a selector, you can define its properties. Similar to how attributes work
                in HTML, CSS properties alter specific attributes of a selector. Returning to the preceding
                example, if you want to change the style of the level-2 headlines on your page to a 14-point
                Verdana font, italic, and blue, you can use the following properties:
                <br><br>
                font-family <br>
                font-style <br>
                font-size <br>
                color <br><br>
                When you specify values for properties, you are creating a declaration for that selector.
                The declaration and selector together are then referred to as a set of rules, or a ruleset. In the
                typical ruleset, the declaration is enclosed in curly brackets after the selector.
                So here are the first few pieces of our ruleset: <br>
                <img class="miniImage" src="./images/cssImg.jpg" alt="cssDescription">
            </p>
            <p>
                And here is how they all fit together to tell the browser to display all level-2 headlines in the
                Verdana font.
            </p>
            <p>
                h2 {font-family: verdana;}
            </p>
            <p>
                To specify the font size, color, and style (italic), we simply add on a few more of those
                properties.
            </p>
            <pre>
            h2 {
            font-family: verdana;
            font-size: 14pt;
            color: blue;
            font-style: italic;}
        </pre>
            <p>
                At this point, you can probably start to see the pattern—a CSS property is followed by
                a colon, and then its value, which in turn is followed by a semicolon.
            </p>


            <h3>Defining Values</h3>
            <p>
                As with attributes in HTML, properties have values. Most values can be specified in terms of
                color, keyword, length, percentage, or URL, as listed in Table 2-2. Length and percentage units
                can also be made positive or negative by adding a plus (+) or minus (−) sign in front of the
                value.
            </p>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Type of Value</th>
                    <th>Description</th>

                    <td>When specifying color in a value, you can do so in one of three ways (see Chapter 3
                        for more information on color): <br>
                        - hexadecimal code, such as #000000 <br>
                        - RGB values, such as rgb (0,0,0) or rgb (0%, 0%, 0%) <br>

                    <td>A keyword is a word defined in CSS that’s translated into a numerical value by the
                        browser. For this reason, keywords are often considered relative because, ultimately,
                        it’s up to the browser to decide how to render the content. An example of a keyword
                        is small.</td>

                    <td>In HTML, most units are defined in pixels. In CSS, however, you have the option of
                        using many other types of units. For example, when specifying text sizes with the
                        font-size property, you can use any of the following. (Abbreviations are shown
                        in parentheses.) <br>
                        - points (pt)—72 points in an inch<br>
                        - picas (pc)—12 points in a pica<br>

                        - exs (ex)—refers to the height of an x in a particular font<br>
                        - inches (in)<br>
                        - millimeters (mm)<br>

                <tr>
                    <td>Percentage</td>
                    <td>Relative percentages can be useful in CSS when used to position elements on a
                        page. This is because percentages allow elements to move around, depending on
                        how large the screen and window sizes are. When used in CSS, a percentage sign
                        (%) following a numerical value, such as 100%, indicates a relationship between the
                        surrounding elements.</td>

                        Similarly, relative URLs (typically those found within the current web site) are
                        referenced in the following manner: url (home.html).</td>
