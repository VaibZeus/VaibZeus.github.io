            <h1>Working with Links</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                The crux of HTML is its capability to reference countless other pieces of information easily
                on the Internet. This is evident because the first two letters in the acronym HTML stand for
                hypertext, or text that is linked to other information.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML enables us to link to other web pages, as well as graphics, multimedia, e-mail
                addresses, newsgroups, and downloadable files. Anything you can access through your
                browser can be linked to from within an HTML document. In fact, one of the easiest ways to
                identify the URL of a page you want to link to is to copy it from the location or address toolbar
                in your web browser. You can then paste it directly into your HTML file.
            </p>

            <h2 id="linksToOther">Add Links to Other Web Pages</h2>
            <p>
                You can add links to other web pages, whether they are part of your web site or someone
                else’s. To do so requires using the a tag:
            <pre>
            &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Use this link to search Google.&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                output: <br>
                <center><a href="http://www.google.com">Use this link to search Google.</a></center>

            </p>
            <p id="tip">
                <b>Tip:</b><br>
                While adding a link to your favorite web site on your page is usually considered
                acceptable, it is never acceptable to copy someone else’s content without their
                permission. If you have any doubts, check with the site’s <a href="./glossary.html#Gadmin" class="glossary_anchors" id="admin">administrator</a> whenever you’re
                linking to a site that isn’t your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The a tag itself doesn’t serve much purpose without its attributes. The most common
                attribute is href, which is short for hypertext reference: it tells the browser where to find
                the information to which you are linking. Other attributes are name, title, <a href="./glossary.html#Gakey" class="glossary_anchors" id="akey">accesskey</a> ,
                tabindex, and target, all of which are discussed in this chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The text included in between the opening and closing a tags is what the person viewing
                your web page can click. In most cases, this text is highlighted as a different color from the
                surrounding text and is underlined.
            </p>
            <p>
                In deciding what to use as the value of your href attribute, consider what type of link you
                want to use. The following are the two basic types of links. <br>
                ● Absolute <br>
                ● Relative
            </p>

            <h3>Absolute Links</h3>
            <p>
                Absolute links are those that include the entire pathname. In most cases, you use absolute
                links when linking to pages or sites that are not part of your own web site. Absolute links must include
                the
                protocol (such as http://) at the beginning of the link. For example, if you are
                linking from your web site to Yahoo!, you type http://www.yahoo.com as your link.
            <pre>
                &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Visit Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                output: <br>
                <center><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Visit Yahoo!</a></center>
            </p>

            <h3>Relative Links</h3>
            <p>
                Relative links are so called because you don’t include the entire pathname of the page to which
                you are linking. Instead, the pathname you use is relative to the current page.
                <br><br>
                Relative links are most commonly used when you want to link from one page in your site
                to another. The following is an example of what a relative link might look like:
            <pre>
                &lt;a href="contactme.html"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/a&gt;
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This link looks for the contactme.html file in the same folder that contains this page. If you
                were linking to a file in another folder below the current one, the value of your href might
                look like the following: <br>
            <pre>
                &lt;a href="wendy/contactme.html"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/a&gt;
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to link to a file in a folder above the folder your page is in, you can add “../”
                for each directory up the tree. So, if the file you are linking to is two folders higher than the
                one you are in, you might use <br>
            <pre>
                &lt;a href="../../contactme.html"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/a&gt;
            </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose you were building a web site for yourself and your family, using the following
                directory structure. You might remember something similar from Chapter 1, where we talked
                about file naming and the anatomy of a URL. Folders and files are <a href="./glossary.html#Gindentation" class="glossary_anchors" id="indentation">indented</a> to indicate that
                they are located on a different level.
            </p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/FileFolders.jpg" alt="Folders">

            <p>
                You are working on the highlighted file: july4.html. This file is located two folders down
                from the home page (index.html) in a folder called holidays. If you want to link back to that
                home page from the july4.html page, you would include a relative link similar to this one:
            </p>
            <img class="miniImage" src="./images/path.jpg" alt="path">


            <h2 id="linksToSame">Add Links to Sections Within the Same Web Page </h2>
            <p>
                When you link to a page, the browser knows what to look for because each page has a name.
                But sometimes you may want to link to a section of text within a page on your web site. To link to a
                section
                of a web page, you must first give that section
                a name.
            </p>

            <h3>Create an Anchor</h3>
            <p>
                An anchor is a place within a page that is given a special name, enabling you to link to it later.
                Without first naming a section, you cannot link to it. The following is an example of an anchor:
            </p>
            <img src="./images/anchor.jpg" alt="anchor" class="miniImage">

            <p>
                In this example, the phrase in between the opening and closing a tags is displayed in the
                web page and labels the anchor as “Section 1.” If you prefer not to include a label for your
                anchor, you can leave that space blank, as in the following example: <br>
            <pre>
                &lt;a name="top"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you could use this invisible anchor at the top of your page, and then link to it from the
                bottom of your page. This would enable visitors to return to the top of a long page easily, with
                only one click and no scrolling.
            </p>

            <h3>Link to an Anchor</h3>
            <p>
                To create the link to an anchor, you also use the a tag and the href attribute, as you would
                when creating any other type of link. To finish the link, you need to include a hash symbol (#)
                and the anchor name as the value of the href attribute.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/AnchorTO.jpg" alt="AnchorTO" class="miniImage">
            <p id="tip">
                <b>NOTE:</b><br>
                If the anchor you are linking to is already visible on the screen (such as how the first
                section is already visible in Figure 5-4), then the browser may not jump to that anchor.
                Similarly, if the anchor being linked to is at the very bottom of the screen (as the third
                section is in Figure 5-4), then the browser also may not jump to that anchor, according
                to your screen size. The reason for this is, if the browser is already at the bottom of the
                page, it cannot go any further and, therefore, can only try to get as close to the anchor
                as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to create a link to a specific section with another page (not the one you are
                currently working on), then you use that page’s filename and the anchor name separated by a
                hash mark (#), as in the following example.
            </p>
            <pre>
            &lt;a href="genealogy.html#intro"&gt;View names beginning with an "A" on our
                genealogy page.&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>
            <p>
                In this case, the browser will first look for genealogy.html and then locate an anchor named
                “intro” on that page.
            </p>


            <h2 id="linksToMedia">Add Links to E-Mail Addresses and Downloadable Files</h2>
            <p>
                Although links to and within web pages are the most common types of links you’ll create, you
                can also link to other types of content on the Internet.
            </p>
            <h3>E-Mail Addresses</h3>
            <p>
                When you want to give someone easy access to your e-mail address, you can include it on your
                page as a mailto link. This means instead of using http:// in front of your link, you use the
                e-mail protocol mailto: to preface your e-mail address.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/mailto.jpg" alt="mailto" class="miniImage">
            <p>
                Clicking this link in a browser causes the visitor’s e-mail program to launch. Then it opens a
                new e-mail message and places your e-mail address in the To: box of that message.
            </p>
            <p id="tip">
                <b>NOTE:</b><br>
                For a mailto link to work, visitors to your web site must have an e-mail program (such
                as Outlook or Mac Mail) set up on their computers. E-mail links like these may not work
                if the visitor uses only a web-based e-mail service such as Gmail or Hotmail.
            </p>

            <h4>Customize the E-Mail Message</h4>
            <p>
                Some browsers will even let you add content to the subject and cc fields in the e-mail by
                entering additional text into the href value. To do so, you add a question mark after the end of
                your e-mail address, and type the word Subject followed by an equal sign (=), along with the
                word or phrase you’d like to use as your subject. This can be particularly useful in helping you
                distinguish mail sent through your web site from your other e-mail.
            </p>

            <img src="./images/customMailto.jpg" alt="customMailto" class="miniImage">
            
            <p>
                Remember, no spaces should be in the value of the href attribute, unless they are part of the
                subject line.
            </p>
            <h3>FTP and Downloadable Files</h3>
            <p>
                The Internet provides many companies with an easy way to transmit files to customers. For
                example, suppose you purchased a piece of software to protect your computer against viruses.
                Eventually, your software must be updated so that it can recognize new viruses. The quickest
                and easiest way to obtain such an update is to download it from the company’s web site. <br>
                When you download files from the Internet that cannot be displayed in your web browser
                (such as software applications and add-ons), you usually do so by accessing the company’s
                FTP site.
            </p>
            <p>
                FTP, which stands for File Transfer Protocol, is a way in which you send and receive files
                over the Internet. Many companies have both HTTP servers, which house their web site, and
                FTP servers, which house their downloadable files.
                To reference a file on an FTP site, you use the a tag and the href attribute with the FTP
                protocol, as in the following example:
            </p>
            <pre>
            &lt;a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/"&gt;Visit the SunSite FTP&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>
            <p>
                Although some FTP sites are anonymous and don’t require a password for access, most
                are private. Secure content is typically made available to a limited audience, which is given
                specific credentials for accessing the content. You won’t be able to access a private FTP site
                without a qualified username and password. If you are linking to a private FTP site, you should
                also consider providing a way for visitors to register or sign up to receive a username and
                password.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, in some cases, you could have downloadable files located right on your web
                server with your web page. These might be movies, sounds, programs, or other documents you
                want to make available to your visitors. You can link to these just as you would any other web
                page, keeping the proper file extension in mind.
            </p>
            <pre>
